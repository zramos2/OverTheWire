The password is stored in the human-readable file in the `inhere` directory.

There are various ways I did it:\
`cd inhere` -> `file -- *` -> `cat ./-file07`
**OR**\
`file inhere/*`\ -> `cat inhere/-file07`
This will show the file type of each file in the **inhere** directory.
From doing the commands, you will see that **-file07** is an ASCII text file.
**-file07** contains the password.

The password for level 5:\
`koReBOKuIDDepwhWk7jZC0RTdopnAYKh`
