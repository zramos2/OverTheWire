The password is stored in the human-readable file in the `inhere` directory.

There are various ways I did it:
```
cd inhere 
file -- * 
cat ./-file07
```

**OR**
```
file inhere/*
cat inhere/-file07
```

This will show the *file type* of each file in the **inhere** directory.
From doing the commands, you will see that **-file07** is an ASCII text file.\
**-file07** contains the password.

The password for level 5:\
