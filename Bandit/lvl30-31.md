There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit30-git` is the same as for the user `bandit30`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

- - -

similar directions as from the previous level.

`mkdir /tmp/level30-31`\
`cd /tmp/level30-31`\
`git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`

Then enter the password for **bandit30**.  Which is:\
`5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf`

- - -

Now once you `cd` into the cloned repo, you can see there is a `README.md` file, that gives us a clue for bandit30's password.
When you `cat` the README.md file there's nothing.

If you type:\
`git log` -> there is only 1 commit\
If you type:\
`git show` -> there are no changes\
If you type:\
`git tag` -> there is a secret tag that we can look at!
- The output says: `secret`

So now type:\
`git show TAG-NAME` -> this is the syntax -> in our case you can type: `git show secret`
- this gives us the password!

- - -

The password for level 31:\
`47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5`
