There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit30-git` is the same as for the user `bandit30`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

- - -

similar directions as from the previous level.

`mkdir /tmp/level30-31`\
`cd /tmp/level30-31`\
`git clone ssh://bandit30-git@localhost/home/bandit30-git/repo`

Then enter the password for **bandit30**.  Which is:\
`5b90576bedb2cc04c86a9e924ce42faf`

Now once you `cd` into the cloned repo, you can see there is a `README.md` file, that gives us a clue for bandit30's password.
