A daemon is listening on **port 30002** and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for **bandit24** and a secret numeric **4-digit pincode**. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.

Let's connect with port 30002 and see what it says:\
`nc localhost 30002`\
If you type the command it will output:\
```
I am the pincode checker for user bandit25. 
Please enter the password for user bandit24 and the secret pincode on a single line, separated by a space.
```

We have to write a script so that it can iteerate through 4-digit combinations.\
To do that let's go make a directory in `/tmp`.\
`mkdir /tmp/bandit24-25`\
`cd /tmp/bandit24-25`\
Then lets make our script! Go ahead and type:\
`vim pincode.sh`\
And put this inside our script:
```
#!/bin/bash

for i in {000..9999}
do
    echo "UoMYTrfrBFHyQXmg6gzctqAwOmw1IohZ $i"
done
```
Remember to change the permissions so that it is executable:\
`chmod +x pincode.sh`

- - -

Go ahead and now run `./pincode.sh | nc localhost 30002`\
This will iterate through our combinations and eventually output the password for level 25!


The password for level 25:\
`uNG9O58gUE7snukf3bvZ0rxhtnjzSGzG`
