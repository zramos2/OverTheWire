A daemon is listening on **port 30002** and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for **bandit24** and a secret numeric **4-digit pincode**. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.


We have to write a script so that it can iteerate through 4-digit combinations.\
To do that let's go make a directory in `/tmp`.\
`mkdir /tmp/bandit24-25`\
`cd /tmp/bandit24-25`\
