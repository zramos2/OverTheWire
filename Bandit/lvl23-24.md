A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler.\
Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

**NOTE**: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!

**NOTE 2**: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around.

As you `cd /etc/cron.d/` and `cat cronjob_bandit24`.\
It outputs:
```
@reboot bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit24 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh &> /dev/null
```

Now go ahead and type `cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh`.\
This will output:
```
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

If you read the script, it says that it is executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname. We assume that `myname` is **bandit24 because according to the  **cronjob_bandit24** this script is being executed by bandit24.\
We can actually manually go inside this directory! 
Type:\
`cd /var/spool/bandit24`\
