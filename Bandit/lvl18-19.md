The password for the next level is stored in a file **readme** in the home direcotry.\
Unfortunately, someone has modified **.bashrc** to log you out when you log in with SSH.

A **.bashrc** file is what happens immediately once you have a shell started, it will **automatically execute** the contents of a **.bashrc** script.\
SSH will allow us to run commands as soon as we have our connection **without being in the shell**.\
Type:\
`ssh bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org "cat readme"`
- `"cat readme"` is passed as an argument in the `ssh` command

The password for level 19:\
`IueksS7Ubh8G3DCwVzrTd8rAVOwq3M5x`

Ignore this.  THIS ISN'T THE RIGHT ANSWER. This is just my attempt of trying to figure out this level. I wanted to put it here in case I need to remember the flag.
`ssh bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 -l bandit18 -t vim .bashrc`
- `-t` : this flag **forces pseudo-terminal** allocation. This can be used to execute programs on a remote machine.
