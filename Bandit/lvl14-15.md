The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port **port 30000** on localhost.

`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000`

We're using the `nc` command to get the password.  nc is short for netcat. 
- localhost for the hostname
- 30000 for the port

We pipe it with our `cat` command because if you just type the `nc` command you can see that it will interact with the server.
