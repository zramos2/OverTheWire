Directions from the level:\
After all this git stuff, its time for another escape. Good luck!

- - -

As soon as it opens up the sessions it everything is upper case.  It's similar to the level 25-26. 

Type:\
`$0` -> this forces to go into the shell from the UPPERCASE SHELL
- a bash variable
- similar to level 25-26 where we were being forced out. You can evoke a shell using 0.

If you then type:\
`whoami` -> this will show you that you are bandit33.  We can get the password!\
Type:\
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit33`

- - -

The password for level 33:\
`c9c3199ddf4121b10cf581a98d51caee`

This is the final level for now.  OverTheWire does not have a level after this.
