A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time-based job scheduler.\
Look at **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.

If you `cd` into the **/etc/cron.d/** directory, you'll see that there is an cron job file labeled as `cronjob_bandit22`.\
If you `cat cronjob_bandit22` it outputs:\
```
@reboot bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit22 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh &> /dev/null
```
You'll see that upon reboot it will perform a **shell script**.\
Now type in `cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit22.sh` to see what is in that **shell script.**\
It outputs:
```
#!/bin/bash
chmod 644 /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit22 > /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv
```
You'll see that it performs a `chmod` command and it puts the **bandit22** password inside a `/tmp` directory.

If you type:\
`ls -l /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`\
From the permissions, you can see it is readable by everyone!

Now type:\
`cat /tmp/t7O6lds9S0RqQh9aMcz6ShpAoZKF7fgv`\
It outputs the password for **level 22**!

The password for level 22:\
`Yk7owGAcWjwMVRwrTesJEwB7WVOiILLI`
