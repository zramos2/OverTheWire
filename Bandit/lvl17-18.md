There are 2 files in the home directory: **passwords.old** and **passwords.new**.\
The password for the next level is in the **passwords.new** and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new.


NOTE: If you have solved this level and see **"ByeBye!"** when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19.


We will the command `diff`.\
`diff passwords.old passwords.new`

This will show you the only line that has been changed between the 2 files. 

The password for level 18:\
`kfBf3eYk5BPBRzwjqutbbfE887SVc5Yd`
