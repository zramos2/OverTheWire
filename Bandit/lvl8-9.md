The password for the next level is stored in the **data.txt** file.  The password is the only line of text that occurs once in the file.

If you `cat data.txt`, you'll see that it's a bunch of random passwords.\
If you use `uniq data.txt`, for some reason it still outputs random passwords.  `uniq` is supposed to omit repeated lines.  If you look at the **man pages** for `uniq`, the description says: **filter adjacent matching lines**. This means that all the ones that are the same have to be put together.

This is where we'll use the `sort` command.\
Type `sort data.txt` and you'll see that the output is all the repeated lines are grouped and matched together.\
Now type `sort data.txt | uniq` and it filters out all the repeating lines. However, this **does NOT** mean that the lines occur once.  It only filters out the repeating lines.

Now type `sort data.txt | uniq -c`.
- `-c` : shows how many times its repeated
If you can see, there is 1 line that occurs once. That is our password! 

- - -

Now type `sort data.txt | uniq -c | grep -v "10"`.
- `grep -v "10"` : this will show everything that does **NOT** contain 10
- `-v` : inverts => do NOT display anything that matches with "10"

The alternative way to find the solution:
`sort data.txt | uniq -u`
- `uniq -u` : the `-u` only ouputs lines that are **NOT** repeated in the input.
