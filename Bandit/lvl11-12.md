The password for the next level is stored in the **data.txt** file, where all lowercase and uppercase letters have been rotated by 13 positions.

There are 2 ways I found to find the password:\
The first way is to use the `tr` command.  tr stands for tranlsation.  tr, from man pages, *translate or delete characters*\
Type `cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`
- `'A-Za-z'` : this is the range of uppercase letters and lowercase letters
- `'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'` : this is the representation of 13 postions shifted
    - the range from N-Z, A-M, n-z, a-m
    - to understand the range, visit the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) of 13 rotations
- `tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`
    - this basically means to replace all uppercase letters in range N-Z and A-M and also replaces all lowercase letters in range n-z and a-m.


The second way is to google ROT13 decoder.\
`cat data.txt` and copy that into a ROT13 decoder to get your password.
