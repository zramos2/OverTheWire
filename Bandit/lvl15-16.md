The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to **port 30001** on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -ign_eof and read the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’ command also works in this version of that command…

The current level's password is in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit15`

Since it is in an SSL connection we will use the `openssl s_client` command.\
`openssl s_client -connect host:port`

Try to type in:\
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`

If you are getting an output somewhere that says **HEARTBEATING**, use `-ign_eof`.  This was given as a hint.\
However, for some reason I wasn't getting the HEARTBEATING word but still put in the `-ign_eof` flag because ther is no other way around it.\
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001 -ign-eof`

You can type this other command as a less elegant way to get the password:\
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 | openssl s_client -connect localhost:30001`


The password for level 16:\
`cluFn7wTiGryunymYOu4RcffSxQluehd`
