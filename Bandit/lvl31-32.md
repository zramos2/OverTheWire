There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit31-git` is the same as for the user `bandit31`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

- - -

similar directions as from the previous level.

`mkdir /tmp/level31-32`\
`cd /tmp/level31-32`\
`git clone ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo`

Then enter the password for **bandit31**.  Which is:\
`47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5`

Now once you `cd` into the cloned repo, you can see there is a `README.md` file, that gives us a clue for bandit31's password
When you `cat` the README.md file this is the output:\
```
This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master
```
Okay, I'm assuming we make a file called **key.txt** and push it to the master branch.
1. `vim key.txt`
- then add `May I come in?`
- then save and exit out of vim
2. `git add key.txt`
- You then get an output
```
The following paths are ignored by one of your .gitignore files:
key.txt
Use -f if you really want to add them.
```
3. We gotta use the `-f` flag.  So type: `git add -f key.txt`
4. `git commit -m "added key.txt"`
5. `git push`
- This then gives us the password!

The password for level 32:\
`56a9bf19c63d650ce78e6ec0354ee45e`
