The password is stored in **/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14** and can only be read by user **bandit14**.\
For this level, you don't get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level.


We have to use the `ssh` command.\
Type `ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost`
- `-i` : stands for *identity file*.  We used this because we were given a private SSH key. 


Now that we're in bandit14, we need the password if we just need direct access to level 14.\
`cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`

The password for level 14:\
`4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e`
