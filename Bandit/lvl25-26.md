Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easyâ€¦ The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.

If you `cd ~` into the home directory and `ls` you can see that it gives us an RSA key.\
You can try to type:\
`ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`\
It will connect but it will automatically end the session.
