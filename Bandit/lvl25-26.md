If you `cd ~` into the home directory and `ls` you can see that it gives us an RSA key.\
You can try to type:\
`ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`\
It will connect but it will automatically end the session.

The shell for user **bandit26** is not **/bin/bash** but something else.  So it is NOT using bash.

Then type:\
`less /etc/passwd`
- `/etc/passwd` is a directory is found in all UNIX like OS.  This is a place that contains information for of the users that are on the system.
- use [this](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-list-users-in-linux/) for more information.

Now you can use arrows to scroll down and find **bandit26**.\
You can see there's a section for bandit26 that has a different entry for the shell: `/usr/bin/showtext`\
It's not **/bin/bash** so what is that?

You can type `cat /usr/bin/showtext` and outputs:
```
#!/bin/sh

export TERM=linux

more ~/text.txt
exit 0
```

You can also type `file /usr/bin/showtext`
