To gain access to the next level, you should use the **setuid binary** in the home directory.\
Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it.  The password for this level can be found in the usual place, **/etc/bandit_pass**, after you have used the **setuid binary**.


What a **setuid** binary does is that it lets you execute, within the scope of that programmer (the scope of the setuid binary) ( within the scope of that executable ) you get to act as another user.

If you type in:\
`ls -l`\
It will output:\
`-rwsr-x--- 1 bandit20 bandit19 7296 May  7  2020 bandit20-do`\
- The **s** in `rws` stands for a **setuid binary.**
- It is owned by `bandit20` but we are `bandit19` 
    - In wargames the **binary** will give us temporary access to the user above us. Then once you're temporarily the next user, you have to figure out how to get it to spit out the password.

If you type in:\
`./bandit20-do`\
It says it wants an **id**. So now type in:\
`./bandit20-do id`\
You can see that our `euid=11020(bandit20)`.  `euid` means our **effective user ID** which means we are acting, for that moment, as bandit20.  We are acting as bandit20 within that executable.
