The password for the next level is in **data.txt** which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.

This level is a bit redundant but I will show you steps that are repeatable to get to the password. 

For this level it may be useful to create a directory under `/tmp` in which you can work using `mkdir`. For example: `mkdir /tmp/banditgame`. Then copy the datafile using `cp`, and rename it using `mv`
- `mkdir /tmp/banditgame`
- `cp data.txt /tmp/banditgame`
- `cd /tmp/banditgame`

- - -

So the hints we're given is that the file is a **hexdump** and it has been **repeatedly compressed.**
- Step 1: to reverse the **hexdump**
    -  `xxd -r data.txt output`
        - xxd : this command is to *make a hexdump or do the reverse*
        - -r : reverse the hexdump
        - ouput : this is where the reverted hexdump will go into
- Step 2: Determine what type of file 
    - `file output`
    - file : this command is to *determine the file type*
    - when you type `file output`, you can see that it is a **gzip compressed data**.  
        - This means we have to **uncompress the file**
- Step 3: Decompress the file
    - `mv output output.gz`
        - We have to change it to a **.gz** file because *gzip decompression* requires the file that ends with **.gz**
    - `gzip -d output.gz`
        - -d : stands for decompress 

Repeat step 2 and 3 until you get the password.\
If the file type is a **bzip2 compressed**, change into **.bz** file.  And uncompress using `bzip2 -d output.bz`\
If the file type is **tar file**, uncompress using `tar xf [file]`
- x : represents to extract
- f : represents to force
