The password for the next level is in **data.txt** which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed.

This level is a bit redundant but I will show you steps that are repeatable to get to the password. 

For this level it may be useful to create a directory under `/tmp` in which you can work using `mkdir`. For example: `mkdir /tmp/banditgame`. Then copy the datafile using `cp`, and rename it using `mv`
- `mkdir /tmp/banditgame`
- `cp data.txt /tmp/banditgame`
- `cd /tmp/banditgame`

So the hints we're given is that the file is a **hexdump** and it has been **repeatedly compressed.**
- Step 1: to reverse the **hexdump**
    -  `xxd -r data.txt output`
        - xxd : this command is to *make a hexdump or do the reverse*
        - -r : reverse the hexdump
        - ouput : this is where the reverted hexdump will go into
- Step 2:
