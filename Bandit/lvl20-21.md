There is a **setuid binary** in the home directory that does the follow:\
- it makes a connection to **localhost** on the port **you specify** as a commandline argument.
- it then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20).
    - if the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: try connecting to your own network **daemon** to see if it works as you think
