The password for the next level can be found by submitting the password of the **current level** to a port on a localhost in the **range 31000 to 32000.**\
First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them.\
Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don't. There is only **1 server** that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

Since we are given a port range, we will use the `nmap` command becuase it is a network and port scanner. 

nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
