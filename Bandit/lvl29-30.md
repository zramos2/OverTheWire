There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit29-git` is the same as for the user `bandit29`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

- - - 

similar directions as from the previous level.

`mkdir /tmp/level29-30`\
`cd /tmp/level29-30`\
`git clone ssh://bandit29-git@localhost/home/bandit29-git/repo`

Then enter the password for **bandit29**.  Which is:\
`bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2`

Now once you `cd` into the cloned repo, You can see there is a `README.md` file, that gives us a clue for bandit30's password.

If we checked `git log`, there's no clue's in there.
Because it is in **git version control** we can see the past branches by typing:\
`git branch -a`\
This will list both remote-tracking branches and local branches.\
Once, you type the `git branch -a` command it will show you different branches that we can checkout.

Let's try to look at the `remotes/origin/dev` branch by typing in:\
`git checkout remotes/origin/dev`
Then type:\
`git logs`\
You can see that there have been some changes that we can see and look at. Try typing:\
`git show`

Once you type the `git show` command you can see the password for bandit30!

The password for level 30:\
