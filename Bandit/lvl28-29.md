There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit28-git` is the same as for the user `bandit28`.

Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

- - -

Similar directions as from the previous level.

`mkdir /tmp/level28-29`\
`cd /tmp/level28-29`\
`git clone ssh://bandit28-git@localhost/home/bandit28-git/repo` 

Then enter the password for **bandit28**.  Which is:\
`0ef186ac70e04ea33b4c1853d2526fa2`

- - -

Now once you `cd` into the clones repo. You can see there is a `README.md` file, that gives us a clue for bandit29's password.\
It doesn't provide the password, but since this is in **git version control** maybe we can find something.

Type:\
`git log`\
One of the commits there says `fix info leak`. That leak might be the password we're looking for.  
Let's take a deeper look into that commit and see the changes of it.

The command we're going to use is:\
`git show COMMIT-HASH`\
The commit-hash will be: `edd935d60906b33f0619605abd1689808ccdd5ee`\
So now we can type:\
`git show edd935d60906b33f0619605abd1689808ccdd5ee`

The command will output the password for level 29!

The password for level 29:\
`bbc96594b4e001778eee9975372716b2`
