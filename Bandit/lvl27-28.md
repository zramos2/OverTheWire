There's a git repository at `ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`\
The password for the user `bandit27-git` is the same as for the user `bandit27`.\
Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.

We first have do make a directory in `/tmp` so that we can clone the repo.\
Type:\
`mkdir /tmp/bandit27-28`\
`cd /tmp/bandit27-28`\
`git clone ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo`

It will then ask for a password.  From the directions, we use the **bandit27 password**. Which is:\
`3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea`
