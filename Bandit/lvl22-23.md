A program is running automatically at regular intervals from **cron**, the time based job scheduler.\
Look in **/etc/cron.d/** for the configuration and see what command is being executed.


Go ahead and type `cd /etc/cron.d/` and then type `cat cronjob_bandit23`.\
The output from the `cronjob_bandit23`:
```
@reboot bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
* * * * * bandit23 /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh  &> /dev/null
```
It looks similar from the previous level.  Now type `cat /usr/bin/cronjob_bandit23.sh`.\
The output you get from the script:
```
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)
mytarget=$(echo I am user $myname | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1)

echo "Copying passwordfile /etc/bandit_pass/$myname to /tmp/$mytarget"

cat /etc/bandit_pass/$myname > /tmp/$mytarget
```
The `whoami` command is just outputting what your current user is.\
If you manually type `echo I am user bandit22 | md5sum`. You can see that it outputs a hash.\
Then looking at the rest of the script, you can see that the hash is used for the `/tmp` directory and **contians the password.**

Now, understanding what the script does, type:\
`echo I am user bandit23 | md5sum`\
This will output the hash for **bandit23**, which is:\
`8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349`\
Then you can type:\
`cat /tmp/8ca319486bfbbc3663ea0fbe81326349`\
You'll then see the password for level 23!


The password for level 23:\
`jc1udXuA1tiHqjIsL8yaapX5XIAI6i0n`
