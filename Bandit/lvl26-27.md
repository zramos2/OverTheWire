Good job getting a shell! Now hurry and grab the password for bandit27!

To get the password for level 27, we have to connect to bandit26 using the instructions from the previous level.\
Because when we connect to bandit26 it will automatically disconnect.  So we will have to do the same procedure as level 26.

I'll copy and paste it here.
1. Make your terminal physically small.
    - we do this to so that the `more` command will need to buffer
2. then type: `ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@localhost`
    - if the connection automatically disconnects, make your terminal even smaller and try to do step 2 again.
3. then type: `v`
    - this will put you into vi editor
4. you can then re-adjust the physical size of your terminal to a bigger more comfortable size
5. go into **normal mode** in vi.  Which all you do to get into that mode is you press the `esc` key on your keyboard.
6. then type: `:set shell=/bin/bash`
7. then type: `:shell`
    - this will let you open up a terminal as **bandit26** as the user
7. then type: `cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26`

So now, once you're in bandit26, type `ls -l` and you'll see that there is a **setuid binary**! (similar to lvl19-20)\
To refresh your memory, **setuid** binary lets you execute, within the scope of that programmer.  In this case, you get to act as bandit27.

What you can do is type:\
`./bandit27-do id`\
You can see that the `euid=11027(bandit27)`.  Our **euid** (effective user ID) means that we can act as bandit27.

Because we can act as **bandit27** we can cat out it's password.\
`./bandit27-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit27`

The password for level 27:\
`3ba3118a22e93127a4ed485be72ef5ea`
