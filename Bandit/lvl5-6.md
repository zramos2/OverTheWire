The password is in a file somewhere in **inhere** directory.

```
find . -type f -size 1033c
```  

- `.` to indicate the current path you are on
- `-type f` => to indicate the folder
- `-size 1033c` => to indicate to find a file by size.  In this case find files with 1033 bytes inside.
    - we chose **1033** as the byte size because lvl 5-6 hints gave us that amount.
