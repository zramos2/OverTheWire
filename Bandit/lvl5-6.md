The password is in a file somewhere in **inhere** directory.\
You need to look for the right file with properties:
- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable

A lot of folders labeled as maybehere.  Each **maybehere** folder contains a random files with different aspects to them.\
We are trying to find the file that meets the properties of this level.  Such as:
- human-readable
- 1033 bytes in size
- not executable
We need to run a specific search.  Most of the files are readable text but only 1 file has 1033 bytes.\
You can use `find . -size 1033c` to find the place of where its located and find the password that way.


`find . -type f -size 1033c -exec cat {} \;`

#### Lets break this down and understand how to use the `find` command 
- `.` to indicate the current path you are on
- `-type f` => to indicate the folder
    - f : regular file
    - d : directory
    - l : symbolic link
    - c : character devices
- `-size 1033c` => to indicate to find a file by size.  In this case find files with 1033 bytes inside.
    - we chose **1033** as the byte size because lvl 5-6 hints gave us that amount.
